<h1>Welcome to Cerence ASR</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Cerence ASR SDK. This SDK is part of the Cerence SDK, which
bundles SDKs of several Cerence embedded technologies into a single uniform SDK.</p>
<p>In this document we will introduce Cerence ASR. We will explain its
novel concepts and design principles. For users coming from earlier
versions of Cerence ASR (VoCon 4), we will explain what has changed
and we will give an introduction to migration from VoCon 4 to Cerence
ASR. We also show where to find tooling and data for Cerence ASR.</p>
<p>Cerence ASR is an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine and a
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine. Cerence ASR is specially
designed to enable fast-track development of embedded speech
applications. Among its uses, Cerence ASR is suitable for automotive dash
board applications (OEM and aftermarket), personal navigation devices,
cell phones and industrial applications like warehouse
automation. Cerence ASR scales from applications that require a limited
number of voice commands to applications that accept voice-destination
entry of hundreds-of-thousands of streets, allow dictation of text
messages. Moreover, Cerence ASR also supports server-side recognition
features to be integrated smoothly with embedded ASR features.</p>
<div class="section" id="cerence-asr-concepts">
<span id="index-0"></span><h2>Cerence ASR Concepts</h2>
<p>Cerence ASR is a set of runtime libraries which allow a developer to
integrate speech recognition (ASR) into their applications.</p>
<p>The Cerence ASR API consist of a few dozen API calls and callback functions. It
comes with several language bindings, with the primary API being a C API. The
Cerence ASR API is a higher level API than the API of previous versions and present
a complete break with the earlier. As the power of embedded platforms has
increased dramatically in the last decade, it is no longer needed to resort to
highly tuned a complex software solution to fit complex speech recognition tasks
to the platform.</p>
<p>The Cerence ASR API is largely an asynchronous API. The underlying speech
recognizer is multi-threaded and can use multiple CPU cores.</p>
<p>Cerence ASR configuration is largely done through files which use the JSON format.</p>
<div class="section" id="stream-based-recognition">
<span id="index-1"></span><h3>Stream-based recognition</h3>
<p>The Cerence ASR system is built around the concept of <strong>stream
based recognition</strong>. This means that audio input is treated as a
potentially endless stream of audio. This presents a significant
paradigm shift from earlier Cerence ASR/VoCon versions which were
utterance based. The ASR system can now be seen as a processor which
looks at an audio stream and returns a <em>stream of events</em> with
information about the audio stream, especially what we think was
spoken. All results are returned as a message block. This block is
mostly in readable text using the JSON format.</p>
<p>Streaming recognition means that Cerence ASR is a one-pass recognition
system. The use of a single pass reduces latency considerably.</p>
<p>Cerence ASR also introduces the possibility to separate the recognition contexts in
two parts. There is an acoustic model dependent part which contains the
vocabulary of an application. This part is still referred to as the recognition
context. And there a separate language language model which models how the words
in the vocabulary can be combined. It is still possible to combine both of these
functions into one recognition context.</p>
<p>Cerence ASR is seamlessly integrated with the Speech Signal
Enhancement (SSE) module through the audio pipeline of the Cerence
SDK. The integration with the SSE module improves performance of the
signal processing system of the ASR further.</p>
<p>Cerence ASR also includes an NLU system which can be used to extract meaning from
words recognized by the ASR system. If needed, the ASR and NLU system can be
used separately, which represents a further change w.r.t. to earlier VoCon
versions.</p>
<p>Last but not least the Cerence ASR system continues to provide integration between
local speech recognition and speech recognition in the cloud (NCS). Through a
plug-in interface, it is also possible to provide integration with a 3rd party
cloud recognition system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asynchronous-processing-a-mind-shift">
<h3>Asynchronous processing: a mind shift</h3>
<p>Cerence ASR is designed to provide responsive speech recognition. This
requirement motived the shift from a synchronous API to a largely asynchronous
API.</p>
<p>To avoid blockage of applications and to keep memory consumption within bounds
the Cerence ASR recognizer will discard information if results cannot be provided in
time. As soon as the recognizer is more than 5 seconds behind real-time it drops
audio. The value of 5 seconds can be adjusted at the cost of more memory usage.</p>
<p>Cerence ASR will also start recognition even if not all resources are available.
Note however that if resources do not become available in time, then they will
be ignored.</p>
<p>Asynchronous programming also means that configurations can be changed during
speech recognition. There is no need to stop audio or a recognizer to switch
models. In fact stopping audio would be simply incorrect because the application
will lose audio.</p>
<p>Due to streaming and on-the-fly reconfiguration, tasks which were special to
earlier VoCon versions, like Wake up word recognition are not special anymore.
They become a task like any other.</p>
<p>The use of timing in results becomes important for applications. applications
should be aware to which segment of input audio an event corresponds.
Applications should be prepared to discard results which apply to time
segments for which already a decision was taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration-over-implementation">
<h3>Configuration over Implementation</h3>
<p>In Cerence ASR, most configuration happens through configuration files that are read
into the engine, rather than by programming an API. The API has been kept small
on purpose to enable fast-track integration and modification of the speech
recognition setup.</p>
<p>Configuration files are written in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.json.org/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>. The content of these configuration
files is specified in <a class="reference internal" href="../external/configuration.html#vocon5-json-configuration"><span class="std std-ref">Cerence ASR JSON configuration reference</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Cerence SDK consists of libraries, tools, documentation and sample code.
The Cerence ASR API comes with several programming language bindings. Some
bindings are not available on all platforms; please consult the general
Cerence SDK documentation for information. Available bindings include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>C</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of this document, we will just refer to all of these as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">API</span></code>.
If examples are given for a specific language binding, it will be
mentioned there and then.</p>
<p>To build applications based on Cerence ASR, you will need access
to the Cerence ASR libraries (provided with this SDK) and a set of
configuration files, all placed into a common directory. The
samples presented later on in this document provide a good
starting point for this.</p>
<p>How the API is used to setup recognition is shown in detail in the
section <a class="reference internal" href="../sections/c_api.html#c-api"><span class="std std-ref">C API</span></a> later on in this document, and in the
<a class="reference internal" href="tools_and_sample_code.html#sdk-samples"><span class="std std-ref">SDK samples</span></a>. Details on the definition and syntax of
configuration files are provided in
<a class="reference internal" href="../external/configuration.html#vocon5-json-configuration"><span class="std std-ref">Cerence ASR JSON configuration reference</span></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cerence-asr-packages">
<h2>Cerence ASR Packages</h2>
<p>The Cerence SDK consists of 3 parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A Runtime Development Package, which is covered by this manual.
This package is available for multiple platforms and has more language
bindings. Details are covered in the <a class="reference internal" href="using_the_csdk_ddfw.html#using-vocon5"><span class="std std-ref">Using Cerence ASR</span></a>.</li>
<li>The Cerence ASR Tools Package.
Tools are delivered in a separate installation package. This package can be
updated independently of the runtime package.</li>
<li>Cerence ASR Data Installer Package.
Data required for speech recognition is installed through separate
installers. Each language has one or more installers. Data is shared between
the runtime package and the tools package. Tools and runtime package come
<strong>without</strong> data. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>The runtime SDK has a simple sample with some data included.
This data is meant for the sample only and should not be used for development</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Most developers will require all 3 packages, but it is possible to install them
separately. If, for example, one has a server dedicated to data production for applications,
then it may for example be useful to install just the Cerence tools without runtime SDK.</p>
<div class="section" id="tools-package">
<h3>Tools package</h3>
<p>Refer to the <a class="reference external" href="../../../../../../../tools/vocon_v5_1_0/doc/vocon/sdk/index.html" title="(in VoCon Application Development Tools v5.1)"><code class="xref any docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VoCon</span> <span class="pre">Tools</span> <span class="pre">Documentation</span></code></a>.
This link is available only if you installed the tools package.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-installers">
<h3>Data installers</h3>
<p>The Cerence data installers come in three flavors. Not all flavors are available
for all languages. Contact your Cerence commercial contact for detailed info on
which data is currently available for a language. The contact should also be
able to provide you with a roadmap for new data buffers. The three flavors are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A <strong>base data installer</strong> contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An acoustic model, the acoustic model provides the possibility to recognize
speech for particular languages. There is one acoustic model per language.</li>
<li>A buffer to configure generation of phonetic transcriptions for <em>general</em>
vocabulary. (CLC)</li>
<li>A second buffer and a CLC buffer to configure
generation of phonetic transcriptions for the <em>music</em> and <em>name</em> domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>This installer is available for all users which have purchased support for a
particular language.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A <strong>message dictation installer</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id3">[2]</a> which contains data to configure VoCon for
recognition of texting messages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A messaging dictation context buffer, which contains the vocabulary
that can be used in messaging.</li>
<li>A messaging dictation Language model buffer, which describes the
syntax of text messages.</li>
<li>A messaging dictation ITN buffer, which helps to format the recognition
output. Formatting means converting <em>twenty five dollars</em> into <em>$25</em> for
example.</li>
</ul>
<p>This installer is not part of the basic offering.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A <strong>VoCon Music Premium 2.0</strong> (VMP) data installer which contains data to help speech
recognition of entries from a GraceNote® music database. This package contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A binary dictionary with VMP 2.0 data which helps generation of phonetic
transcriptions for a particular language.</li>
</ul>
<p>This installer is not part of the basic offering.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="migration-from-vocon-4">
<h2>Migration from VoCon 4</h2>
<p>The shift from a low-level API programmatic API to a higher level API with
configuration files means that users of older VoCon versions have to rework the
integration of speech into their application.</p>
<p>It is also the case that numerous technologically outdated options and
features in VoCon 4.x have been removed from Cerence ASR.</p>
<p>Data formalisms, on the other hand, have remained compatible in Cerence ASR to a large
extent. Apart from recognition contexts.</p>
<p>Configuration of cloud recognition tasks remains the same as the Cerence Cloud
Services add-on of VoCon 4.</p>
