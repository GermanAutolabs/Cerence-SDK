<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>In order to deploy successfully an automatic speech recognizer like <em>Cerence ASR</em>,
the application developer needs to pay sufficient attention to the following issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>audio quality: the audio hardware should be designed to ensure that
the speech recognizer receives properly conditioned audio input</li>
<li>computing resources: sufficient memory and processing power should be
available to achieve the required speed and to be able to support
adequate application grammars</li>
<li>grammar or SLM design: grammars should be designed to lead to the desired
level of flexibility and user friendliness while maintaining sufficient
accuracy.</li>
<li>parameter tuning: based on application data, the parameters
controlling the ASR engine should be set such that the recognizer is
well-behaved regarding speed, accuracy, sensitivity, rejection…</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This application note deals with the first aspect: audio quality requirements
and resulting constraints on the audio hardware.</p>
<p>The <em>Cerence ASR speech recognition engine</em> contains several algorithms and
techniques that will make it robust to variations in audio parameters such
as speech level, noise level, noise spectral shape and bandwidth limitations.
However, careful design of the audio input channel is advantageous for the
recognition accuracy and robustness of the recognizer.</p>
<p>The recommendations in this note apply to usage on embedded devices, in-car
implementation, industrial usage, and PC multimedia or game applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-audio-chain">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">THE AUDIO CHAIN</a></h2>
<p>The audio chain consists of the microphone, the electronics following it
(filters, amplifier, gain control…) and the <em>A/D Converter (ADC)</em>. The output
of the audio chain is the digitized speech signal fed to the <em>ASR</em> engine. In
order to maximize the performance of the recognizer, this output should
comply with a series of quality requirements. These audio quality
requirements concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>the speech level and speech dynamic at the input of the <em>ADC</em>,</li>
<li>the sampling frequency and sampling resolution of the digital signal
at the output of the <em>ADC</em>,</li>
<li>the overall signal bandwidth,</li>
<li>the distortion and noise in the audio chain,</li>
<li>the ambient (acoustic) noise at the microphone.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The audio quality requirements are detailed in the next section. Failure to
comply with these requirements will usually result in sub-optimal
performance.</p>
<p>Recommendations on audio chain design and audio hardware selection so as to
meet the audio quality requirements are given in the last section of this
document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audio-quality-requirements">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">AUDIO QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="speech-level-and-gain-control">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Speech Level and Gain Control</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Cerence ASR engine</em> is not sensitive to the speech level as such. However,
the signal should be properly scaled so that, on one hand, clipping, or other
non-linear distortions by the microphone amplifier or A/D converter are
avoided and, on the other hand, sufficient SNR with respect to the amplifier
and quantization noise is available. In most cases it is best to allow for
some clipping on unusually loud signals than to have low-level signals
drowned in quantization noise when the A/D resolution is limited.</p>
<p>The speech signal should be scaled so that the peak signal level is about 4
times smaller than the full scale of the A/D converter under normal loud
operation of the device. This will provide sufficient headroom (i.e. 12
dB or 2 bits) to avoid clipping of the speech signal, while still providing
sufficient dynamic range for 14-bit (or more) <em>A/D converters</em> (see section on
<a class="reference internal" href="#signal-resolution-and-sampling-frequency">Signal Resolution and Sampling Frequency</a> below). With <em>normal loud operation</em>
is meant: a male speaker speaking up (without shouting) while driving at highway
speeds, at normal distance from the microphone. When using an artificial head/torso
to adjust this gain, this loud speech level approximately corresponds to a 100dB
unweighted SPL level, at the Mouth Reference Position of the artificial head. The
Mouth Reference Position is 2.5cm in front of the lip plane of the artificial mouth.</p>
<p>The speech level (amplifier gain) should preferably be set prior to recognition.
That is, either at design time or at run-time during a “sound-check” procedure.
If needed, the gain can be controlled automatically, e.g. by an <em>AGC</em>, but the
gain variations during the speech utterances should be slow enough so as not
to impact the recognition process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="signal-resolution-and-sampling-frequency">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Signal Resolution and Sampling Frequency</a></h3>
<p>The <em>A/D Converter</em> should provide an <em>effective</em> dynamic range of 12 bits for
the speech signal. Accounting for the 2-bit headroom and the fact that the
least significant bits of <em>ADCs</em> are often random (because of electronic and
quantization noise), this implies that a 16-bit <em>ADC</em> should be preferred. The
resolution of the ADC can be reduced only when the signal is properly scaled
so as to reduce the risk of clipping (e.g., via a good quality <em>AGC</em>) and when
the electronics components are of good quality so as to minimize electronic
and quantization noise, e.g. a <em>real</em> 14-bit <em>ADC</em> may be used. 16 bits <em>ADCs</em>
remain strongly advised though.</p>
<p>The <em>Cerence ASR</em> engine natively supports 16kHz audio sampling
frequency and it supports the possibility to downsample the
input signal from a higher sampling frequency to the above sampling
frequency (See also paragraph <a class="reference internal" href="#frequency-conversion">Frequency conversion</a> below).</p>
<p>Anti-alias filters should be used to prevent the aliasing of high frequency
components while preserving the speech bandwidth of interest. The attenuation
of the anti-alias filter at the Nyquist frequency should be 20dB or better
with a high order roll-off.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overall-bandwidth">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Overall Bandwidth</a></h3>
<p>The combined transfer function of the microphone and of the electronics
should present a smooth or flat frequency characteristic in the required
signal bandwidth. <a class="reference internal" href="#table-1">Table 1</a> summarizes the signal resolution, signal bandwidth
and sampling frequency requirements of the Cerence ASR engine. For the 16kHz
version, using a cutoff frequency larger than 7 kHz will result in a small
accuracy improvement (using a 7.3 kHz cutoff frequency can result in up to 5%
relative improvement of the recognition accuracy). Passband ripples of up to
3 dB and a roll-off of up to 6 dB over the full bandwidth can be tolerated.
Notch filters should not be part of the audio channel.</p>
<p>It may be advantageous to actively filter the signal below 200Hz when
dominant low frequency noise is present, such as in cars. This will allow an
increase of the speech signal level without clipping caused by low frequency
noise. The high-pass filter pass-band frequency characteristics should not
affect the overall frequency response requirements.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Non-Linear Distortion and Noise in the Audio Chain</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="dc-offsets-throughout-the-chain">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">DC-Offsets throughout the Chain</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Cerence ASR</em> engine is not directly sensitive to <em>DC</em> offsets. However,
asymmetry in the amplifier and <em>A/D converter</em> should be limited in order not
to compromise the effective full signal range of the <em>ADC</em>. <em>DC</em> transients
should similarly be avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="electrical-noise-and-interference">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Electrical Noise and Interference</a></h4>
<p>After tuning all signal gains as explained in <em>Speech Level and Gain Control</em>,
the total electric noise and interference signal should be smaller than 3 bits. This
includes noise introduced by the microphone power supply, amplifier, ADC, etc.
Hum or other periodic interferences should be reduced to amplitude of 70dB below full range.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="non-linear-distortion">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Non-Linear Distortion</a></h4>
<p>Analog distortion in the microphone, amplifier, or electronic input circuit
is not critical if well below the audible threshold.</p>
<p>Similarly, if transmission links such as wireless FM links are used, they
should not distort the signal. The <em>total harmonic distortion (THD)</em> should be
kept below 1%.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, clipping of the input signal at the <em>A/D conversion</em>
stage should be avoided. However, small levels of ADC clipping can be
tolerated on unusually loud signals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ambient-noise">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Ambient Noise</a></h3>
<p>The presence of background noise adversely affects the performance of a speech
recognition engine. Speech recognition accuracy is strongly dependent on the
<em>signal-to-noise (SNR)</em>: lower <em>SNR</em> values lead to lower recognition accuracy.</p>
<p>In the context of speech processing, there are several ways to define the
<em>SNR</em>. In this document, the SNR is defined as the ratio (in dB(A)) of the
average signal level during the speech segments of the signal to the average
signal level during the silence/background noise segments of the signal, with
a <em>A-frequency weighting</em> <a class="reference internal" href="#iec" id="id1">[IEC]</a>. This is the so-called “A-weighted biased
segmental SNR”. Note that using different definitions or even different tools
to measure <em>SNR</em> on speech signals make comparisons of values difficult.</p>
<p>The <em>SNR</em> of the signal fed into the recognizer should ideally be equal to or
better than 20dB(A) for stationary noise sources. When the <em>SNR</em> degrades, the
error rate will go up, gradually at first, and then more sharply. The actual
<em>SNR</em> limit depends on the characteristics of the noise (spectral shape,
temporal properties) and on the complexity of the recognition task that must
be performed. For instance, for stationary car noise on a simple command and
control task, an SNR as low as 10dB(A) can be tolerated. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> give a
typical example of the evolution of the error rate as a function of the SNR
for a command &amp; control application in a car driving at various speeds.</p>
<div class="section" id="loudspeaker-feedback">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Loudspeaker Feedback</a></h4>
<p>A speech recognition engine is sensitive to non-stationary background sources
such as acoustic echo from music, background speech, or dialogue prompts. In
embedded devices, the distance from loudspeaker to microphone is typically
small, leading to loudspeaker-microphone feedback. In automotive, the output
level of loudspeakers is generally high, also leading to loudspeaker-microphone
feedback. Feedback from loudspeakers to the microphone should be eliminated by
muting the loudspeaker signal when the recognizer is active or by a careful
placement of loudspeakers and directional microphone such that leakage of the
loudspeakers is 30 dB below the speech signal. In other cases, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adaptive</span> <span class="pre">echo</span>
<span class="pre">cancellation</span> <span class="pre">(AEC)</span></code> may have to be used to obtain sufficient attenuation of
the loudspeaker signal. However, if echo cancellation is used, careful design
of the <em>AEC</em> algorithm is needed to prevent distortion of the speech signal fed
to the recognizer. Some additional considerations of audio hardware requirements
for <em>AEC</em> can be found in <a class="reference internal" href="#aec" id="id2">[AEC]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="hardware-recommendations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">HARDWARE RECOMMENDATIONS</a></h2>
<p>The audio quality requirements of the previous sections translate into a
series of recommendations for the various components of the audio chain
hardware.</p>
<div class="section" id="microphone">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Microphone</a></h3>
<p>Directional-type microphones are preferred. The main lobe size depends on the
intended usage of the device and the position of the speaker relative to the
microphone. Under normal operation, the speaker should remain inside the main
lobe of the microphone directivity pattern. The microphone should be placed
as close as possible to the speaker in order to maximize the <em>SNR</em>.</p>
<p>The microphone should comply with the bandwidth requirements of the previous
section.</p>
<div class="section" id="in-car-microphones">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">In-Car Microphones</a></h4>
<p>For in-car operation, the type of the microphone and its position with
respect to the speaker can greatly influence the speech recognition
performance <a class="reference internal" href="#smol" id="id3">[SMOL]</a>. The optimal microphone setup is dependent on both the car
cabin acoustical properties and the position of the speaker (driver and/or
passenger). Typical positions include microphones mounted on the A-pillar, on
the roof above the driver, on the rear-view mirror, and on the dashboard. As
a rule-of-thumb, best speech recognition results are achieved when the
microphone is directed toward the speaker and positioned as close as possible
to the speaker mouth.</p>
<p>Production microphones for automotive application may present significant
variations in gain and characteristics. This should be taken into account
when selecting a microphone and setting up the audio channel. The tolerance
on the microphone characteristics should be such that different samples will
comply with the specification set forth in this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="close-talk-microphones">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Close-Talk Microphones</a></h4>
<p>When a close-talk microphone (e.g. a headset-mounted microphone) is used, the
microphone should be positioned as close as possible to the mouth to maximize
SNR, but should not be positioned directly in front of the mouth to avoid
capturing breath noises, lip-smacks, and other mouth-produced noises. For
example, the boom of a headset-mounted microphone should be adjusted so that
the microphone is located at the corner of the mouth, about 2 cm from the
lips’ corner. If possible, a sound-check procedure can be included in the
application to make sure that the microphone is correctly positioned and
delivers the proper signal levels.</p>
<p>For operation in noisy environment, noise-canceling close-talk microphones
are preferred.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="microphone-arrays">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Microphone Arrays</a></h4>
<p>Microphone arrays or other forms of multi-microphone solutions can be
deployed with Cerence ASR. When properly set-up, multi-microphone solutions can
improve the SNR of the speech signal and lead to recognition accuracy
improvements. However, they should be configured carefully to make sure their
noise rejection properties do not come at the cost of signal distortion that
would adversely affect the recognizer’s operation. The resulting global audio
processing chain must still comply with all other signal quality
requirements: bandwidth, distortion, linearity, and other requirements listed
earlier in this document. In practice, experimentation will be necessary as
the behavioral characteristics of microphone arrays vary widely. The
microphone array system should be looked at as a whole, including post-processor
such as residual noise cancellers.</p>
<p>Two special topics deserve attention when using microphone array or other
advanced signal processing techniques</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The adaptation mechanisms in adaptive microphone arrays can interfere
with the adaptive mechanisms in the recognizer. If adaptation occurs in
the microphone array, it should be carefully designed to minimize the
interference. For instance, the speech channel’s frequency response
should not vary rapidly; noise rejection should not change significantly
during the speech segments, etc.</li>
<li>Signal enhancement techniques often have a trade-off between the
level of noise removal and the level of signal distortion they introduce.
Speech recognizers are more sensitive to signal distortion than humans.
Therefore, systems tuned for the best perceptual signal quality will
generally not be optimal for speech recognizers. They will have to be
retuned for a different operating point with less signal distortion and
less noise removal.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="microphone-sensitivity">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Microphone Sensitivity</a></h4>
<p>The microphone sensitivity should be selected to match the microphone input
circuitry and the acoustic signal level conditions in the intended mode of
operation.</p>
<p>More sensitive microphones do not always yield better performance as they may
also capture more background noise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="external-noise-cancellers">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">External Noise Cancellers</a></h3>
<p>Since Cerence ASR already includes sophisticated internal noise cancellation, no
gain is expected from external noise cancellers in normal operating
conditions. If an external noise canceller cannot be turned off or removed,
it should be tuned for operation with the <em>Cerence ASR engine</em>. The comments of the
microphone array section on advanced signal processing techniques do also
apply.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="electronics-transmission-links">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id25">Electronics &amp; Transmission Links</a></h3>
<p>The electronics includes the microphone preamplifier, the input amplifier and
gain control, optional filters (e.g., high-pass filters), transmission
channels (e.g., wireless links)… that are present between the microphone
and the <em>ADC</em>.</p>
<p>Bandwidth, <em>DC-offset</em>, noise and non-linear distortion should comply with the
audio requirements of the previous section.</p>
<p>The <em>ADC</em> integration requires some care to prevent spurious noise (e.g. coming
from the digital section of the board) from degrading the audio signal.</p>
<p>If an analog transmission link such as a FM wireless microphone link is used
as part of the audio chain, it should not introduce perceptible distortion of
the signal.</p>
<p>Similar conditions apply to digital transmission links. In particular, when
digital data compression techniques are used, the restored PCM data should
comply with all the requirements set forth in this document and present small
signal distortion level when compared to the original uncompressed signal.
For instance, ADPCM with a compression ratio of 2:1 does not yield measurable
degradation of speech recognition performance. However, aggressive speech
compression schemes should be avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frequency-conversion">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">Frequency Conversion</a></h3>
<p>If sampling frequencies have to be converted (e.g. downsampling a 48 kHz
audio data stream on a MOST bus to 16 kHz), the downsampling filter has to be
carefully designed to avoid the introduction of harmful artifacts. Keep in
mind that avoiding conversion completely is the preferred way (conversion
takes CPU time and may degrade accuracy).</p>
<p>For the <em>Cerence ASR engine</em>, you can use the downsampler module provided inside
the engine. This is required when using the Speech Signal enhancement
module in front of Cerence ASR together with so-called side-band information.
When you use the subsampler, the engine accepts a number of predefined
sampling frequencies (see the documentation of the Cerence ASR).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automatic-gain-control">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id27">Automatic Gain Control</a></h3>
<p>In general we strongly recommend against using an <em>AGC</em> mechanism with <em>ASR</em>.
Fixed gain settings are preferred. However, if an AGC is required (e.g.
because an <em>ADC</em> with less than 16-bit resolution has been selected), it should
be optimized to work with the ASR application.</p>
<p>The <em>Cerence ASR engine</em> comes with a built-in <em>AGC</em> algorithm that is designed to
work transparently for the user.</p>
<p>If an external <em>AGC</em> is used, it should be carefully designed so as not to
affect the performance of the recognition engine:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <em>AGC</em> circuit should distinguish between speech and silence.
This to avoid that the AGC misinterprets the silence or background noise
as a low speech signal and increases gain accordingly, leading to the
first utterance when the speaker resumes speaking being over-amplified.</li>
<li>The <em>AGC</em> gain adjustments can interact negatively with the
internal dynamic adjustments in the ASR software and result in degraded
recognition performance. To prevent this from happening, the AGC should
work with long attack and decay time constants on the order of 3 to 5
seconds.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-d-converter">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">A/D Converter</a></h3>
<p>A 16-bit <em>A/D converter</em> is preferred. An effective dynamic range of 12 bits
for the speech signal at the output of the <em>ADC</em> is mandatory. Hence, only when
the signal can be properly scaled, the resolution of the ADC can be reduced
below 16 bits.</p>
